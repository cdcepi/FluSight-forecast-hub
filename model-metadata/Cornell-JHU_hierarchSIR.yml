methods: "An SIR mechanistic disease dynamics model wrapped in a Bayesian hierarchical (across-season) statistical model."
methods_long: "An SIR model with unknown case ascertainment, basic reproduction number, population immunity and a splined effective reproduction number is used to model seasonal influenza dynamics in a given season. Across-season trends ('hyperparameters') in the SIR model's parameters are derived by wrapping it in an across-season Bayesian hierarchical model. Hyperparameters are used as priors when forecasting the current season. Disease model integrated in C++ and bound to Python with pybind11, Bayesian hierarchical posterior probability coded in raw Python and sampled using the ensemble sampler of Goodman and Weare available in `emcee` (motivation: computationally inefficient but amazingly robust). Workflow automatically pulls NHSN HRD data through a timed GH actions and deploys it on a local runner (Dell Optiplex 3050 Micro running Ubuntu Server). Average time from data pull to forecast ready: 3 hours."
