methods_long: "Median ensemble of hospitalization quantile forecasts. The ensemble is constructed by taking the median of the quantile forecasts from all eligible models for each location. Categorical forecasts are generated by interpolating the CDF of the hospitalization quantile forecasts evaluated at the given thresholds. Eligible models are those that are supported by the Epistorm Center. These models are:  MIGHTE-Nsemble, MIGHTE-Joint, CEPH-Rtrend_fluH,  MOBS-EpyStrain_Flu,  MOBS-GLEAM_RL_FLUH, NU-PGF_FLUH, NEU_ISI-FluBcast,  NEU_ISI-AdaptiveEnsemble, Gatech-ensemble_prob, Gatech-ensemble_stat."
