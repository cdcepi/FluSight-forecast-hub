designated_model: true
data_inputs: US Department of Health and Human Services, COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries
methods: An equal weighted ensemble of 3 component models - a compartmental model, an ETS model, and a baseline model of random walk with drift.
methods_long: The mechanistic model is a stochastic SEIR model, with a sequential Monte Carlo based inference. Exponential trend smoothing model and random walk models use implementations available in the fable R package. The model estimates are solely the responsibility of the contributors and do not represent, nor are endorsed by, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
