data_inputs: "Weekly incident flu hospitalizations, projections submitted to the Flu SMH"
methods_long: "The adaptive ensemble approach combines projections from the Flu Scenario Modeling Hub across all defined scenarios. The approach leverages new surveillance data points to generate an adaptive ensemble by dynamically rejecting the subset of individual models' trajectories that do not closely match the observed trends."
