data_inputs: "Weekly flu hospitalizations, Weekly weather for each states, Google search volume for flu-related symptoms, Change healthcare claims data (accessed via covidcast)"
methods: "Ensemble of time series models including ARIMA, LSTM and GRU"
methods_long: "This model predicts state-level influenza hospitalizations through an ensemble of time series forecasting methods at three hierarchical levels: individual state-level forecasts using ARIMA, region-level predictions with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, and a single Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model that encompasses all states. These three-level models are combined to yield the final ensemble prediction."
