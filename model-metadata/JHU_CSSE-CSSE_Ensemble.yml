methods_long: "This model forecasts state-level influenza hospitalizations using a combination of time series forecasting methods, organized across three hierarchical levels. At the individual state level, forecasts are generated using Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing. For regional predictions, which group states based on recent flu activity trends identified through the Louvain method, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are employed. Additionally, a LSTM model that covers all states is implemented. These three-tiered model outputs are integrated, selecting weights based on their recent performance in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to produce the final prediction."
