methods: "A branching process model based on an extended SLIR compartmental structure, analytically solved with probability generating functions (PGFs)."
data_inputs: "Weekly incident flu hospitalizations"
methods_long: "A branching process model analytically solved with probability generating functions (PGFs), enabling Bayesian inference of the time-varying reproduction number and mechanistic modeling of immunity. The branching process approximates the full stochastic evolution of a discrete-time, single-population, SLIR compartmental model, extended to evaluate weekly hospitalizations resulting from infections."
