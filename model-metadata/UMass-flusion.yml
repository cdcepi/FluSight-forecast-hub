methods_long: "
  2023-10-14: A linear pool of two sub-ensembles, one fit with all available data and one fit dropping the last data point which may be subject to revisions. Each sub-ensemble is an equally-weighted Vincent median ensemble of three components: 1) an AR(8) model fit only to HHS data on a fourth root scale; 2) a gradient boosting model fit to data from all three sources with uncertainty based on bootstrapping out-of-bag prediction errors; 3) a gradient boosting model fit to all three data sources with quantile regression separately for each quantile level, with predictions sorted to address quantile crossing.
  2023-10-21: Fit only to the data release including data up through the week of 2023-10-14. Dropped bootstrap method, so submission is a quantile averaged ensemble of AR(8) and the gradient boosting model with quantile regression for all quantiles."
