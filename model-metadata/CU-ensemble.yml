data_inputs: "1) State specific weekly total number of hospitalized patients taken from the US Department of Health and Human Services, COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries (target data), 2) State specific weekly weighted influenza-like illness values downloaded from the CDC website, 3) State specific weekly percentage of positive influenza lab tests downloaded from the CDC FluView website, and 4) State specific daily average absolute humidity values"
methods: "A weighted ensemble of 5 component models: 1)SIR compartmental model with EAKF, 2)Seasonal-Drift model, 3)Exponetial-Smoothing model, 4)Gradient-Boosting model, 5)Deep-learning model"
methods_long: "The dynamical model simulates influenza transmission in each state and the US using a humidity-driven SIR dynamics. Model variables and parameters are sequentially updated each week using the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter and new observations. Forecasts are generated by integrating the optimized model into the future. Four statitical models are included in the ensemble: A seasonal-drift model - a random drift model where the mean and variance of the drift for each week and location are derived by sampling first-order lags in incidence from historical data where sampling is performed using a window around the current week of the year (e.g., during epiweek 47, the model samples from a window around epiweek 47 in previous years). Two statistical models implemented within the python library darts are employed: 1) Holt Winter’s Exponential Smoothing (ES), a classical statistical model that decomposes a time series to a baseline, trend and seasonal components, 2) Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), a ML ensemble decision tree method designed for classification and regression tasks that has been effectively adapted for time series forecasting. The fifth model used is a deep-learning model (details TBD). Past years ILI data is transformed to resemble hospitalization data and is used to train the models. Labratory data is optionally used as covariate with model fitting and predicitons. To build the ensemble, the predictions of the component models are weighted using the sum of inverse WIS scores over past weeks, with greater importance given to more recent weeks. The period for calculating weights is horizon-specific and includes only the weeks where WIS scores could be evaluated (e.g., weights for the 4-week horizon are calculated using a longer historical window than those for the 1-week horizon). The weights are location-specific and are recomputed for each forecast week. Peak week distribution and incidence is obtained by combining forecasts of the seasonal-drift model and the SIR-EAKF model."
backfill_adjustment: To nowcast we are currently using gradient boosting over the error given by (current observed cases - final observed cases).  Conformal intervals are generated via Adaptive Conformal Prediction (APCI).
