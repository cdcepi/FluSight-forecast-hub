methods: "Dynamic mode decomposition for time-series."
data_inputs: "Daily and weekly incident flu hospitalizations, queried through FluSight"
methods_long: "A sliding window is used to construct an temporally local approximation of the Koopman operator. Time-delays and radial basis functions are used for the lifting to function space. All states (and D.C. + P.R.) are used to construct the approximation of the Koopman operator to estimate couplings/correlations. Gaussian noise, of variance estiamted from previous years, is used to sample possible variants of the data to approximate the forecast percentiles."
