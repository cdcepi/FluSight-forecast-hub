methods: "Simple time-series baseline model predicting forward the most recent week of reported laboratory confirmed influenza hospital admissions."
data_inputs: "Weekly incident flu hospitalizations from HealthData.gov COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries."
methods_long: "The median prediction at all future horizons
  is the most recent observed weekly incidence.  To get a distribution around
  the median, we look at how much incidence has changed from week to week in
  the past, and we allow for the possibility that similar changes will occur
  again in the future.

  In more technical detail, forecasts of incidence are generated through the
  following procedure: for each location, 1) Calculate first differences of
  incidence; 2) Collect all first differences and their negatives; 3) For each
  time step, i) Sample first differences in incidence and add to the most recent
  observed incidence; ii) Enforce that the median of the predictive distribution
  for incidence is equal to the most recent observed incidence; iii) truncate
  the predictive distribution for incidence at 0.

  Reimplementation of the 2022-23 baseline model contributed to by Evan L. Ray,
  Nutcha Wattanachit, and Ryan Tibshirani."
