methods: "Age structured, extended SLIR model."
data_inputs: "Weekly incident flu hospitalizations, queried through HHS"
methods_long: "The Epydemix framework integrates demographic data with synthetic, high-resolution contact matrices that represent daily mixing across households, schools, workplaces, and community settings at a state-specific level. The infection dynamics are simulated using an age-structured SLIR-like model which is extended to include asymptomatic transmission and hospitalization. The model incorporates vaccination, school calendars that modulate the school contact matrix, seasonal variation in transmissibility, and residual immunity. Model parameters are calibrated to HHS hospitalization data using approximate Bayesian computation."
