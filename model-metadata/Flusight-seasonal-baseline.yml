methods: "Kernel density estimation baseline predicting seasonal peak week and intensity of reported laboratory confirmed influenza hospital admissions."
data_inputs: "Weekly incident flu hospital admissions from HealthData.gov COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries and weekly rates of flu hospital admissions from FluSurv-NET."
methods_long: "These seasonal target estimates were calculated based on a combination of
  FluSurv-NET (2010/11-2019/20) and HHS/NHSN (2021/22-2023/24) data on influenza hospital admissions. 
  For the peak week target, peak weeks were identified from each jurisdiction and season; peak week replicates 
  consisted of national values as well as jurisdiction specific values (14 states for FluSurv-NET and all 
  states, DC, and Puerto Rico for HHS Protect/NHSN). Gaussian kernel density estimation was used to approximate 
  the distribution of peak weeks and hospitalization rates to then generate predicted peak probabilities 
  for each week of the flu season. The intial distribution encompassed epidemic weeks 40 through 22, 
  but the probabilities were proportionally redistributed to align with the current season's challenge 
  period (epidemic weeks 47 through 22). The same distribution was replicated for the national level and 
  all jurisdictions.

  For the peak intensity baseline, kernel density estimation was performed on historic weekly hospitalization 
  rates from FluSurv-NET and HHS Protect/NHSN (reported counts converted to rates using population size) using 
  the same seasons specified above and a range of prespecified quantiles, which were then used to estimate the 
  peak intensity by identifying the maximum value across all quantiles. Once quantile distributions for peak 
  rates were identified, state population sizes from the 2023 U.S Census Estimates were used to translate these 
  rates into weekly counts of influenza hospital admissions.

  This method was adapted from previous FluSight Challenge seasonal baselines that included peak week and peak 
  intensity as targets, specifically from the 2015/16 to 2019/20 seasons."
