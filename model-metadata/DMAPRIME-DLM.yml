methods_long: "The Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) is a state-space time series model that captures evolving patterns through unobserved components including level, trend, and seasonality. Unlike static regression, DLM allows parameters to adapt over time via Kalman filtering, making it well-suited for modeling non-stationary disease dynamics. The model incorporates exogenous covariates such as lagged EHR positive tests, inpatient hospitalizations, and holiday indicators to enhance predictive accuracy for weekly influenza hospital admissions. EHR covariates from regional health systems serve as leading indicators. 
The model employs a recursive multi-horizon forecasting strategy where a 1-step ahead model is iteratively applied to generate forecasts for h=0,1,2,3 (1-4 weeks ahead)."
