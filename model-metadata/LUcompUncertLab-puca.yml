methods_long: "Suppose you are given a TX(S-1) dataset Y of past incident flu hosps and a current, partially observed season y which when complete will be TX1. 
Pre-process Y by smoothing with a Gaussian filter (sd =2). 
Then, puca (poo-kah) is the following model
Y = F @ P + U + errx
y = (F @ Q + u )*s + c + erry 
Where F is a TXL matrix of latent time series and L is strictly smaller than S-1.
P is a LX(S-1) matrix and Q is a LX1 vector of weights for the columns in F. 
U is a set of S-1 reverse random walks and u is a reverse random walk that are linked hierarchically.  
errx is a N(0,sigma) and erry is a N(0,s*sigma) .
