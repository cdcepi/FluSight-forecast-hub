methods: "A generative denoising diffusion probabilistic model of Influenza dynamics generates synthetic epidemic trajectories, conditioned on past ground-truth data using an inpainting algorithm."
data_inputs: "inference on the target data only, but the machine learning model trained on Fluview, FlepiMoP projections, and SMH projections for the US Flu Scenario modeling hub."
methods_long: "We use a generative AI method, denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPMs), to generate epidemic trajectories (we treat influenza epidemic curves as images (axes are time and location, a pixel value is e.g incident hospitalization and stay close to the image generation literature). So our model account characterizes the uncertainty that exists in the space of possible flu trajectories. Spatial correlation is considered as all the features of the full images should be reproduced in our generated images. Then, we use the COPaint algorithm to inpaint the future from ground-truth data."
