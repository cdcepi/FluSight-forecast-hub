methods_long: "Using data from 2022 onwards, the climatological model uses samples from the 7 weeks centered around the target week and reference week to form the quantiles for the target week, as one might use climate information to form a meteorological forecast. To get more variation at some potential issue of generalization, one can form quantiles after aggregating across geographic values as well as years (after converting to a rate based case count). This model uses a simple average of the geo-specific quantiles and the geo-aggregated quantiles."
