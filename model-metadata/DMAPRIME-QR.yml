methods_long: "A multi-quantile regression model that integrates real-time electronic health record (EHR) surveillance data with historical CDC hospitalization trends to generate probabilistic nowcasts and short-term forecasts. Key predictors include weekly flu test volumes, positive test counts, inpatient hospitalizations, and their week-over-week changes (1-week and 2-week momentum), alongside a single-week lagged CDC admission value and temporal features including seasonality indicators, holiday effects, and school break periods. The model uses log-transformed count variables and exponential back-transformation. For multi-week forecasts (0-3 weeks ahead), the model employs a recursive forecasting strategy where EHR predictors are projected forward using exponentially-weighted 4-week trends (giving higher weight to more recent observations), and the previous week's prediction serves as the lagged input for subsequent forecast horizons. Uncertainty is quantified through 23 predicted quantiles (0.01 to 0.99), with isotonic regression applied to enforce monotonicity across quantile levels. Spatial correlation is not explicitly modeled as predictions are location-specific. Model updated January 21, 2026: reduced from two-week to one-week lagged target and implemented weighted recent trends for improved responsiveness to rapid changes in hospitalization patterns."
