data_inputs: "CDC weekly flu hospital admissions (NHSN), EHR surveillance data (weekly flu test volumes, positive tests, inpatient hospitalizations)"
methods: "A parametric asymmetric quantile regression model integrating real-time EHR surveillance data with historical CDC trends. Predictors include weekly Prisma Health EHR flu test volumes, positive tests, inpatient hospitalizations, log-transformed 1–2 week momentum, and seasonal/holiday indicators. Forecasts use a recursive approach where the model median is generated by propagating the most recent observed predictor values forward across four horizons (nowcast, 1-, 2-, and 3-week ahead). Forecast uncertainty scales with horizon using a residual standard deviation multiplier (0.7 at nowcast to 1.15 at 3-week ahead). An asymmetric squeeze is applied to upper quantiles: the Q50–Q75 range is compressed by 20% and the Q75–Q99 range by 50%, reflecting the epidemiological asymmetry that admissions are less likely to spike unexpectedly than to decline during the post-peak phase. Quantile monotonicity is enforced via isotonic regression. Model updated February 25, 2026: Surge-floor logic temporarily disabled during confirmed post-peak seasonal decline to prevent upward median bias when laboratory signals reflect residual activity rather than a genuine rebound."
