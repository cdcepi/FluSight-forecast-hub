methods_long: "A multi-quantile regression model that integrates real-time electronic health record (EHR) surveillance data with historical CDC hospitalization trends to generate probabilistic nowcasts and short-term forecasts. Key predictors include weekly flu test volumes, positive test counts, inpatient hospitalizations, and their week-over-week changes, alongside lagged CDC admission values and temporal features including seasonality indicators, holiday effects, and school break periods. For multi-week forecasts (0-3 weeks ahead), the model uses a recursive forecasting strategy where EHR predictors are projected forward based on recent 4-week trends, and previous predictions serve as lagged inputs for subsequent forecast horizons."
