methods: "Parametric Asymmetric Quantile Regression with recursive trend-based forecasting"
methods_long: "A parametric asymmetric quantile regression model integrating real-time EHR surveillance data with historical CDC hospitalization trends. Predictors include weekly Prisma Health EHR flu test volumes, positive tests, inpatient hospitalizations, log-transformed values with 1–2 week momentum, a one-week lagged CDC hospitalization target, and seasonal and holiday indicators. All counts are modeled on the log scale and back-transformed. Forecasts for 0–3 weeks ahead use a recursive approach, projecting EHR predictors using exponentially weighted trends with adaptive safety valves that modulate damping based on EHR trend direction. Uncertainty is quantified parametrically using residual standard deviation, with an asymmetric squeeze applied to compress the upper tail during declining phases. Growth-clipping triggers are implemented to restrict upward momentum when recent trends are negative, and a maximum seasonal cap prevents unrealistic outliers. Isotonic regression acts as a final fail-safe to enforce quantile monotonicity after manual upper-quantile compression during declining phases. Model updated February 04, 2026: transitioned to guarded parametric approach with stability safeguards for rapid hospitalization changes."
