methods: "Parametric Asymmetric Quantile Regression with recursive trend-based forecasting"
methods_long: "A parametric asymmetric quantile regression model integrating real-time EHR surveillance data with historical CDC trends. Predictors include weekly Prisma Health EHR flu test volumes, positive tests, inpatient hospitalizations, log-transformed 1–2 week momentum, and seasonal/holiday indicators. Forecasts use a recursive approach with a Signal-Dominant Pivot. If positive tests grow >5%, the model implements a Median Trend Reversal, forcing the median to follow a 5% weekly growth floor. This prevents recent admission drops from anchoring the forecast downward. During surges, lagging inpatient predictors are neutralized (held at current observed levels) to ensure the leading laboratory signal drives the trajectory. Uncertainty is quantified via residual standard deviation with an asymmetric squeeze: the inner 50% interval follows the pivoted median, while the outer 95% tail is compressed (0.7) for seasonal realism. Isotonic regression enforces quantile monotonicity. Model updated February 19, 2026: Transitioned to surge-floor logic to eliminate downward median drift during laboratory-confirmed rebounds."
