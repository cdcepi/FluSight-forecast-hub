designated_model: True
data_inputs: "Weekly incident flu hospitalizations from HealthData.gov, and outpatient ILI from ILINet"
methods: "Ensemble of traditional and deep predictive models trained on combination of historical and synthetic data"
methods_long: "We train an ensemble of deep learning approachs including ARIMA, LSTM, EpiDeep, EpiFNP, Transformer models on historical and synthetic data. Our synthetic data is generated using a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on historical data. We use the ensemble of models to predict the target data."
