methods_long: "2023-10-11: SEIRH model variant was fit bc KM27 model was not yet complete.
2023-10-12: KM27 model is completed and ready for training/submission for the following week.
2023-10-18: KM27 model was incorrect last week. i spernt the entire week correcting the model. Thete is a final bug in the mehtod i use to aggregate from day forecasts to week forecasts. 
i will need to solve this bug before the next submission date.
2023-11-01:Corrected KM27 and added in knowledge about flu: R0 is constrained to be between 1.1 and 2.5, vaccine proprtion is between 0.2 and 0.8. Generatioanl interval is Neg Bin and on average 3.6 days.
Changed from Normal observational process to GammaPoisson. The GP is good but very computationally slow.
Still cranky about how sensitive this model is to changes. This round ill try to focus on assigning seasons to distinct clusters.
2023-11-08:Added in priors for peak intensity and timing, and for the first two weeks of the season (MMWR 40 and 41). This adds stability to the model and speed.
2023-11-23:Found two major bugs in the code. One is frustrating and the other very subtle. First bug was training on hospitalization data the same as last year. i missed the message about a change in the hosp data and so have been training my model on the wrong data up until now. The second bug is a subtle fix in the code that took some time to find.
2023-12-09: Added back QO data, truncated to be two weeks before the forecast submission date. Forecasts look ok except for FIP=72. i'll need to investigate.
2023-12-16: Ran versions without and without the QO data. For the majority of locations i chose the model that included QO data. There were 3 locations, 30,37,56 where i thought the model without QO data was better and so chose those forecasts instead.
2023-12-30: Not much to report. Still running a few slightly different versions of the model and then hand picking which model to submit for which location.
2024-03-20: Not in love with Loc 2 but otherwise forecasts look ok
2024-11-17: new model up and running. Looks like good results visually.
2024-11-27: didnt have much time to work on hosp forecasts this week. Need to account for these outlier states.
2024-12-04: Forecasts look ok for the most part. SOme discrepancies in states. Didnt have time to improve the model this week.
2025-01-08:Made pretty significant updates a few weeks ago that i think improved model performance.
