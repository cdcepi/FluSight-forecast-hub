methods_long: "This is a US national and state-level multi-method model
  forecasting the new influenza hospitalizations. Multiple methods include
  ARIMA (optimized for length of observed data), exponential smoothing (optimized for length of observed data), LSTM model, Kalman filter, and
  piecewise-linear approximation model for trend projection. The model forecasts are combined using Bayesian model averaging, mean-, or median-based ensembling strategies."
