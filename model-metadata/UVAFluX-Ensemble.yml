  forecasting the new influenza hospitalizations. Multiple methods include
  ARIMA (optimized for length of observed data), exponential smoothing (optimized for length of observed data), LSTM model, Kalman filter, and
  piecewise-linear approximation model for trend projection. The model forecasts are combined using Bayesian model averaging, mean-, or median-based ensembling strategies."
