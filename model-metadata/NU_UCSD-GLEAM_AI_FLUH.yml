methods_long: "This a deep surrogate model trained to mimic MOBS-GLEAM_FLUH model.\
  \ GLEAM_FLUH is based on a metapopulation approach in which the world is divided\
  \ into geographical subpopulations. \nHuman mobility between subpopulations is represented\
  \ on a network. This mobility data layer identifies the numbers of individuals traveling\
  \ from one sub-population to another. \nThe mobility network is made up of different\
  \ kinds of mobility processes, from short-range commuting between nearby subpopulations\
  \ to intercontinental flights. \nTo model short-range mobility such as commuting\
  \ or car travel, we rely on databases collected from the Offices of Statistics of\
  \ 30 countries on five continents. \nSuperimposed on the worldwide population and\
  \ mobility layers is an agent-based epidemic model that defines the infection and\
  \ population dynamics."
