methods: "SEIR mechanistic model for each US state with Bayesian inference."
data_inputs: "Daily incident flu hospitalizations, queried through covidData, weekly NREVSS queried through `cdcfluview`."
methods_long: "A mechanistic model generates infections for each day in season for three age groups (children, adults and 65+ elderly) and three flu subtypes (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, B), some of these infections lead to observed data (with delays). The observed data used to calculate the log-likelihood is daily HHS incident hospitalisations per day, weekly flu A/B test positives from clinical labs, and total test distribution across ages and flu subtypes from Public Health labs."
