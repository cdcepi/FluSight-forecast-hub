methods_long: "Ensemble of statistical and machine learning time series model predictions, including ARIMA, ARGO, ARGO2, and LightGBM models. ARIMA, ARGO (AutoRegression with GOogle search data) and LightGBM models are used to produce univariate forecasts for each location, incorporating Google Trends search volumes of flu-related terms as exogenous variables. ARGO2 (2-step Augmented Regression with GOogle data) performs state-level prediction using both state- and national-level ARGO predictions. The results from ARIMA, ARGO, ARGO2, and LightGBM models are combined into the final ensemble predictions."
