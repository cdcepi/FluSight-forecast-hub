methods_long: "Deep neural network model with conformal predictions. The neural network architecture is a sequence-to-sequence model based on recurrent units and self-attention modules. It is trained in a multi-task setting where each region is considered a task. The uncertainty quantification is conducted post hoc with conformal predictions that follows adaptive conformal inference to adapt to distribution shifts. Spatial correlation is not considered."
